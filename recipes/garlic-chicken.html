    <h2 class="ing-hl">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ing-list chicken">
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon thyme leaves</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
 </ul>
        <h2 class="dir-hl">Directions</h2>
        <ol class="dir-list chicken">
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides; add to Instant Pot®. Cook one side at a time until both sides of the chicken are a golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onion and sauté for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Pour in white wine and stir to scrape brown bits from the bottom of the pot. Stir in chicken broth and lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook until broth has reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the Sauté function.</li>
            <li>Return chicken Instant Pot®. Close and lock the lid. Select High pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Select the Sauté mode and bring sauce to a boil. Whisk in butter or margarine, heavy cream, salt, and thyme. Cook until sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve chicken drizzled with the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
